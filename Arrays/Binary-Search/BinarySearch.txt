Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target,
write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
Example 2: 

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 < nums[i], target < 104
All the integers in nums are unique.
nums is sorted in ascending order.


Thoughts before coding :-

- Basic iterative approach simple iterate through all array O(N).
- Divide and Conquer can be applied.

Solution : -

1st Approach
- Iterative divide and conquer simple while loop till low < high.
- Mid Calculation l + (h - l)/2 . (IMP) (Case Index Calc between Index 2 and 5)

2nd Approach
- Recursive same divide and conquer
